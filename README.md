## 📸 Instagram Double Tap Like Effect

A smooth and modern Instagram-style double tap like animation built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
Double-tapping the image triggers a heart pop effect with scaling, rotation, and fade — just like Instagram’s UI.

## 💡 How the Animation Works
1. User double-taps the image  
2. JavaScript detects the double tap  
3. Heart icon appears  
4. Icon scales up, rotates, and fades out  
5. Icon resets back to hidden state  

This perfectly replicates the Instagram double-tap like interaction.
